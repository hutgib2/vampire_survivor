# Vampire Survivor Game

This is a simply 2D shooter game, where the player has to avoid touching the enemies and kill as many enemies as possible before dying .

There are many many powerups that will spawn around the map, some temporarily upgrade the player's weapon, while others may increase his speed, slow down nearby enemies, plant mines and so on...

There is also a boss that spawns every minute who has increased health and can shoot projectiles.

See how long you can survive!
